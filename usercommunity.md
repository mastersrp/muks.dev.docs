Introduction
=============

In a great community striving on creativity and productivity, social interaction, and fun, the users are the most important ingredient. Without the users, there would be none of the previously mentioned.  
Keeping the users safe and productive requires them to be less constrained not only by the system itself, but from rules and requirements as well.
