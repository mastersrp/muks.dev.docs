Introduction
=============

A community like Muks.dk constantly evolving,  society in constant need of new features and ideas, requres an underlying system that can compliment that. The currently used system, PHP-Fusion, is highly restrictive in what it allows done and how it allows things done.  
Therefore the underlying system must respond very well to new ideas and changes. An interface to compliment this must be implemented in a way that does not disturb other parts of the system.  
  
Coding Style
============

There are three principles that MUST be followed at all times, regardless of coding style specifics.  
They are as follows:  
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it
  
If the above guidelines are followed without a doubt the system will be heading in the right and bright direction.  
  
The rest of the coding style section is to be published later, when the language has been chosen.
